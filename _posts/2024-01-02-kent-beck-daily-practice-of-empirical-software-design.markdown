Kent shares some of his perspectives on the difficulties of applying of software design every day:

I really enjoyed this talk, the pacing was great, the examples were highly understandable and I really like his explanations of all the trade-offs you meet every day. 
 
PS And what I love most is that his new book is not dogmatic in the title. It does not tell you what to do, it asks you: [Tidy First?](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tidy-first/9781098151232/)

PPS The question mark is so powerful in every day problem solving. It does not think for you; it guides your thinking to hopefully better results. It's sadly very effortful (since it requires turning on the slow part of your brain) and I have not found a great way to convince teams of their effectiveness yet.
