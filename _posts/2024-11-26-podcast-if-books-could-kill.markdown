title: "Podcast: If Books Could Kill"
---
A podcast I enjoy that takes apart "airport" bestsellers of today (The Secret) and the past (The Population Bomb) and digs into the circumstances the books were written in, the authors and the background: [If Books Could Kill by Michael Hobbes & Peter Shamshiri](https://pod.link/1651876897).
